# **Semi-Supervised Weed Detection**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on semi-supervised weed detection using a combination of 200 labeled images and 1000 unlabeled images of crops and weeds. The goal is to effectively leverage the small labeled dataset and the large unlabeled dataset to train a weed detection model that performs well across various conditions.
